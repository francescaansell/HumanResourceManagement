(5) Create Complaint (Employee)
* Can create an complaint with description, those involved, date of occurance, and date submitted 
* to be implemented 
  * view complaint status 
    * this will include being able to see who has been assigned and what action has/or will be taken 
  * possibly find a way to indentify those involed as employees within the system rather than just a string
  * add type attribute to complaint and allow supervisor to sort as such 


Other importants changes that need to be made: 
* change .equals() for employee to check against more than just the last name


****** Would rather make what we have really good instead of trying to half implement multiple things ************
